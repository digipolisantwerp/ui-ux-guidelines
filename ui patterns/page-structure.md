# Basic Page Structure

## Situation
What is the best way to structure the main skeleton for `content web sites` or `functional applications`? 

### Meta navigation
The first horizontal section from the top of every page is the location for the `meta navigation`. This *bar* provides room for a number of elements:

- logo
- language switch
- app level search
- contact info
- app switcher
- username of the logged in user
- avatar of the logged in user

the idea is that these elements return consistently between content sites and functional apps. They are in a sense global features. Note, however, that these elements are still within the context of the content site/functional app at hand.

### Main menu
The main menu is a navigational element that allows the user to switch between the various pages of the content web site or features of the functional app.

There are two possibilities:

1. horizontal: The main menu is located as the second horizontal section, underneath the meta navigation section.
2. vertical: The main menu is located on 
- the left in case of desktop mode
- at the bottom for mobile form factors.

## Suitable for
This pattern is a base pattern, in other words, use it as a guide. As usual it is not a mandatory pattern, though highly recommended.
